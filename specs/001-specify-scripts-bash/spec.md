# Feature Specification: ChromLLM - Smart Chrome Extension with LLM Integration

**Feature Branch**: `001-specify-scripts-bash`
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "ChromLLM - 基于大模型的智能Chrome插件与后端服务套件"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Basic Content Extraction and Question Answering (Priority: P1)

As a user browsing any webpage, I want to extract the main content and ask questions about it, so that I can quickly understand and interact with the content without leaving the page.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - enabling users to interact with webpage content through natural language questions.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by installing the Chrome extension, visiting a webpage, extracting content, and asking questions about that content.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I'm on a webpage with text content, **When** I click the extension icon and ask "What is this page about?", **Then** I receive a concise summary of the page content
2. **Given** I'm on a technical documentation page, **When** I ask "How do I implement this feature?", **Then** I receive step-by-step implementation guidance

### User Story 2 - Real-time Streaming Responses (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to see LLM responses streamed in real-time as they're generated, so that I don't have to wait for the complete response and can start reading immediately.

**Why this priority**: Real-time streaming significantly improves user experience by reducing perceived latency and providing immediate feedback.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by asking a complex question and verifying that responses appear incrementally rather than all at once.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I ask a complex question requiring detailed explanation, **When** the LLM starts generating a response, **Then** I see the answer appear word by word in real-time
2. **Given** I'm on a slow network connection, **When** I ask a question, **Then** I still receive partial responses as they become available

### User Story 3 - Session Management and History (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want to maintain conversation history and manage multiple sessions, so that I can refer back to previous interactions and continue conversations across browsing sessions.

**Why this priority**: Session management enhances the utility of the tool by preserving context and enabling ongoing conversations.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by having multiple conversations, closing/reopening the extension, and verifying history persistence.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I've had previous conversations, **When** I reopen the extension, **Then** I can see my conversation history
2. **Given** I'm in the middle of a conversation, **When** I navigate to a different page, **Then** I can continue the conversation with the new page context

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the webpage has no extractable text content?
- How does the system handle network connectivity issues during streaming?
- What happens when the LLM API rate limits are exceeded?
- How does the system handle pages with mixed languages?
- What happens when users ask questions about sensitive or inappropriate content?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST extract main text content from any webpage while filtering ads and redundant elements
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a Chrome extension popup interface for user interactions and question input
- **FR-003**: System MUST support real-time streaming of LLM responses to provide immediate feedback
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain conversation history and session context across browsing sessions
- **FR-005**: System MUST implement secure authentication using JWT tokens for user sessions
- **FR-006**: System MUST cache frequently accessed data using Redis to improve performance
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle network connectivity issues gracefully with appropriate error messages
- **FR-008**: System MUST respect user privacy by only accessing webpage content when explicitly authorized

### Key Entities

- **UserSession**: Represents an authenticated user session with conversation history and preferences
- **Conversation**: Represents a series of questions and answers within a specific webpage context
- **WebpageContent**: Represents extracted and processed content from webpages for LLM context
- **LLMResponse**: Represents streaming responses from large language model APIs
