# Implementation Plan: ChromLLM - Smart Chrome Extension with LLM Integration

**Branch**: `001-specify-scripts-bash` | **Date**: 2025-10-16 | **Spec**: `/specs/001-specify-scripts-bash/spec.md`
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-specify-scripts-bash/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Build a Chrome extension with Go backend that enables users to extract webpage content and interact with it using large language models through real-time streaming responses. The system will provide intelligent question-answering capabilities while maintaining conversation history and ensuring privacy.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: JavaScript (Chrome Extension Manifest V3), Go 1.21+
**Primary Dependencies**: Gin framework, OpenAI API, Redis, WebSocket, Chrome Extension APIs
**Storage**: Redis for caching, Browser localStorage for extension data
**Testing**: Jest (extension), Go testing framework, Postman/curl for API testing
**Target Platform**: Chrome browser (desktop/mobile), Linux server for backend
**Project Type**: Web application (frontend Chrome extension + backend API)
**Performance Goals**: 3-second response time for initial LLM interaction, 1000 concurrent users
**Constraints**: Manifest V3 security restrictions, LLM API rate limits, browser memory limits
**Scale/Scope**: 10k users, 100k conversations per month, 50MB extension size limit

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Code Quality Excellence
- ✅ Chrome extension follows Manifest V3 best practices
- ✅ Go backend follows standard Go conventions and style guide
- ✅ Automated linting configured for both extension and backend
- ✅ Documentation includes API specifications and user guides

### Comprehensive Testing Standards
- ✅ TDD approach planned for all features
- ✅ Unit tests cover content extraction and API endpoints
- ✅ Integration tests validate Chrome extension + backend interaction
- ✅ Performance tests measure response times and streaming efficiency

### User Experience Consistency
- ✅ Consistent UI patterns across extension popup
- ✅ Graceful error handling for network and LLM failures
- ✅ Performance targets aligned with user expectations
- ✅ Accessibility considerations included in design

### Performance Requirements
- ✅ 3-second response time target for LLM interactions
- ✅ Memory optimization for browser extension
- ✅ Caching strategy using Redis
- ✅ Real-time streaming for immediate feedback

### Security and Privacy
- ✅ JWT authentication for user sessions
- ✅ Secure transmission protocols (HTTPS/WSS)
- ✅ Privacy-first content extraction (user authorization required)
- ✅ Secure storage of API keys and configuration

**GATE STATUS**: PASS - All constitution principles satisfied

**Structure Decision**: Web application structure selected with separate Chrome extension and Go backend components. This separation allows independent development and deployment of the extension and API services while maintaining clear communication contracts between them.

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |

| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
