# Research: ChromLLM Technical Decisions

**Feature**: Smart Chrome Extension with LLM Integration
**Date**: 2025-10-16
**Branch**: 001-specify-scripts-bash

## Technical Decisions

### 1. Chrome Extension Architecture (Manifest V3)

**Decision**: Use Chrome Extension Manifest V3 with Service Worker architecture

**Rationale**:
- Manifest V3 is the current standard with enhanced security and performance
- Service Workers replace background pages, reducing memory usage
- Required for Chrome Web Store submission
- Better security model with declarative net requests

**Alternatives considered**:
- Manifest V2: Deprecated, no longer accepted in Chrome Web Store
- Progressive Web App: Limited access to browser APIs, cannot run content scripts

### 2. Backend Technology Stack

**Decision**: Go with Gin framework for backend API

**Rationale**:
- High performance and low memory footprint
- Excellent concurrency support for handling multiple WebSocket connections
- Strong standard library and mature ecosystem
- Type safety and compile-time error checking

**Alternatives considered**:
- Node.js/Express: Higher memory usage, less efficient for concurrent connections
- Python/FastAPI: Slower performance, higher resource consumption
- Rust: Steeper learning curve, longer development time

### 3. Real-time Communication

**Decision**: WebSocket for real-time LLM streaming responses

**Rationale**:
- Bidirectional communication for streaming responses
- Lower latency compared to HTTP polling
- Better user experience with progressive response display
- Standard WebSocket API available in browsers

**Alternatives considered**:
- Server-Sent Events (SSE): Unidirectional, limited browser support
- HTTP Long Polling: Higher latency, more complex implementation
- gRPC-Web: More complex setup, limited browser support

### 4. LLM Integration

**Decision**: OpenAI API with streaming support

**Rationale**:
- Industry-leading model quality and reliability
- Comprehensive streaming API support
- Well-documented and stable
- Support for multiple models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4)

**Alternatives considered**:
- Anthropic Claude: Limited streaming support, newer API
- Google Gemini: Less mature streaming implementation
- Self-hosted models: Higher infrastructure complexity

### 5. Caching Strategy

**Decision**: Redis for session and response caching

**Rationale**:
- High-performance in-memory data store
- Built-in expiration and persistence
- Excellent for session management
- Reduces LLM API calls and costs

**Alternatives considered**:
- In-memory cache: Not persistent across restarts
- Database caching: Higher latency
- CDN caching: Not suitable for dynamic content

### 6. Authentication

**Decision**: JWT tokens for stateless authentication

**Rationale**:
- Stateless architecture simplifies scaling
- Standardized and widely supported
- Self-contained tokens reduce database queries
- Easy to implement across frontend and backend

**Alternatives considered**:
- Session-based auth: Requires session storage
- OAuth: Overkill for simple extension authentication
- API keys: Less secure for user-specific data

### 7. Content Extraction

**Decision**: Content scripts with DOM parsing

**Rationale**:
- Direct access to webpage DOM
- Can filter ads and irrelevant content
- Runs in isolated environment for security
- Triggered only when extension is active

**Alternatives considered**:
- Server-side scraping: Requires sending URLs, privacy concerns
- Readability libraries: Additional dependencies, less control
- Browser automation: Too heavy for extension context

### 8. Data Storage

**Decision**: Browser localStorage for extension data

**Rationale**:
- Built-in browser storage
- Persists across browser sessions
- No server dependencies for extension data
- Secure sandboxed environment

**Alternatives considered**:
- IndexedDB: Overkill for simple key-value storage
- Chrome storage API: Chrome-specific, less portable
- Server storage: Requires network calls, slower

### 9. Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Jest for extension, Go testing for backend

**Rationale**:
- Jest is standard for JavaScript/TypeScript testing
- Go testing framework is robust and well-integrated
- Both support unit, integration, and contract testing
- Good mocking and assertion libraries available

**Alternatives considered**:
- Cypress: Too heavy for extension unit testing
- Playwright: Better for E2E, overkill for unit tests
- Testify: Go testing alternative, but standard library sufficient

### 10. Deployment Strategy

**Decision**: Docker containers for backend, Chrome Web Store for extension

**Rationale**:
- Docker provides consistent deployment environment
- Easy scaling and orchestration
- Chrome Web Store provides distribution and updates
- Automatic extension updates for users

**Alternatives considered**:
- Manual deployment: Error-prone, not scalable
- Kubernetes: Overkill for initial deployment
- Self-hosted extension distribution: Complex update mechanism

## Resolved Clarifications

### Content Extraction Scope
**Clarification**: Content extraction will focus on main text content while filtering ads, navigation, and other irrelevant elements. The system will use DOM parsing techniques to identify and extract meaningful content.

### Error Handling Strategy
**Clarification**: The system will implement graceful degradation with user-friendly error messages for network issues, LLM API failures, and content extraction problems. Users will receive clear feedback on what went wrong and potential solutions.

### Privacy and Security
**Clarification**: Content extraction will only occur when users explicitly trigger the extension. No webpage data will be sent to the backend without user action. All communications will use HTTPS/WSS encryption.

### Performance Targets
**Clarification**: The system targets 3-second response time for initial LLM interactions, 500ms extension popup load time, and support for 1000 concurrent users without performance degradation.

## Implementation Notes

- All technical decisions align with the project constitution principles
- The architecture supports independent development of extension and backend
- Security and privacy considerations are built into the design
- Performance targets are achievable with the selected technologies
- The system is designed for scalability and maintainability
