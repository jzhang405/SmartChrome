# SmartChrome Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality Excellence
All code MUST follow established style guides and best practices. Code reviews are mandatory for all changes. Automated linting and formatting tools MUST be configured and enforced. Code duplication MUST be minimized through abstraction and reuse. Documentation MUST be comprehensive and kept current with implementation changes.

### II. Comprehensive Testing Standards
Test-Driven Development (TDD) is mandatory for all features. Tests MUST be written before implementation and verified to fail initially. Unit tests MUST cover all business logic and edge cases. Integration tests MUST validate component interactions and API contracts. Performance tests MUST be included for critical user journeys.

### III. User Experience Consistency
User interfaces MUST provide consistent interaction patterns and visual design. Error handling MUST be graceful and provide actionable feedback to users. Performance MUST meet or exceed user expectations for responsiveness. Accessibility standards MUST be followed to ensure inclusive design.

### IV. Performance Requirements
System MUST respond to user interactions within 200ms for optimal user experience. Memory usage MUST be optimized and monitored to prevent browser performance degradation. Network requests MUST be minimized through efficient caching strategies. Large language model responses MUST be streamed to provide real-time feedback.

### V. Security and Privacy
User data MUST be protected through encryption and secure transmission protocols. Authentication MUST be implemented using industry-standard JWT tokens. Content extraction MUST respect user privacy and only access data when explicitly authorized. API keys and sensitive configuration MUST be stored securely.

## Quality Standards

### Code Quality Metrics
- Code coverage MUST exceed 80% for all critical paths
- Static analysis MUST pass with zero critical issues
- Code complexity MUST remain below cyclomatic complexity threshold of 10
- Documentation MUST be generated for all public APIs and interfaces

### Performance Benchmarks
- Chrome extension popup MUST load within 500ms
- Content extraction MUST complete within 2 seconds
- LLM responses MUST begin streaming within 3 seconds
- API endpoints MUST handle 1000 concurrent users

## Development Workflow

### Code Review Process
All changes MUST undergo peer review before merging. Reviewers MUST verify compliance with constitution principles. Automated checks MUST pass before code review can begin. Documentation updates MUST accompany all feature changes.

### Testing Requirements
Unit tests MUST be written for all new functionality. Integration tests MUST validate cross-component interactions. Performance tests MUST be included for user-facing features. Security tests MUST verify data protection measures.

### Deployment Standards
All deployments MUST include rollback procedures. Performance monitoring MUST be active in production environments. Error tracking MUST be implemented for all user-facing features. Security scanning MUST be performed before each release.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and standards. Amendments require documentation of the change rationale, approval from project maintainers, and a migration plan for existing code. All pull requests and code reviews MUST verify compliance with these principles. Complexity introduced by any change MUST be justified with clear business value. Use CLAUDE.md for runtime development guidance.
